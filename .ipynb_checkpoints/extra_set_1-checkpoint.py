def run_length_encode(message):
    '''Run-Length Encode.

    Compress a string by counting consecutive identical characters.
    For example, "AAABBC" would be compressed to "A3B2C1".

    The format is the character followed by the number of times it appears.

    Examples:
    run_length_encode("AABBC") -> "A2B2C1"
    run_length_encode("AAAAA") -> "A5"
    run_length_encode("XYZ") -> "X1Y1Z1"
    run_length_encode("") -> ""

    Parameters
    ----------
    message: str
        a string of uppercase English letters.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        the run-length-encoded string.
    '''
    # Replace `pass` with your code.
    # Stay within the function. Only use the parameters as input. The function should return your answer.
    pass

def run_length_decode(encoded_message):
    '''Run-Length Decode.

    Decompress a string that was encoded using the run-length-encode function.
    For example, "A3B2C1" would be decompressed to "AAABBC".

    You can assume that the count of each character will be a single digit (1-9).

    Examples:
    run_length_decode("A2B2C1") -> "AABBC"
    run_length_decode("A5") -> "AAAAA"
    run_length_decode("X1Y1Z1") -> "XYZ"
    run_length_decode("") -> ""

    Parameters
    ----------
    encoded_message: str
        a string in run-length-encoded format.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        the decoded string.
    '''
    # Replace `pass` with your code.
    # Stay within the function. Only use the parameters as input. The function should return your answer.
    pass

def validate_parentheses(expression):
    '''Validate Parentheses.

    Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',
    determine if the input string is valid.

    An input string is valid if:
    1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

    This problem is a classic test of using a stack data structure. You can
    simulate a stack using a Python list's `append()` and `pop()` methods.

    Examples:
    validate_parentheses("()") -> True
    validate_parentheses("()[]{}") -> True
    validate_parentheses("(]") -> False
    validate_parentheses("([)]") -> False
    validate_parentheses("{[]}") -> True
    validate_parentheses("") -> True

    Parameters
    ----------
    expression: str
        A string containing only bracket characters.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the expression's parentheses are valid, False otherwise.

    pass

def isbn_validator(isbn):
    '''ISBN-13 Validator.

    Validates a 13-digit International Standard Book Number (ISBN).

    The validation algorithm for an ISBN-13 is as follows:
    1. The ISBN is a 13-digit number. The input string may contain hyphens,
       which should be ignored. If the input string, after removing hyphens,
       is not 13 digits long, it is invalid.
    2. The first 12 digits are used to calculate a check digit.
    3. Multiply each digit by a weight. The first digit is multiplied by 1,
       the second by 3, the third by 1, the fourth by 3, and so on,
       alternating between 1 and 3.
    4. Sum all of these 12 weighted products.
    5. Take the sum modulo 10.
    6. If the result is 0, the check digit is 0. Otherwise, subtract the
       result from 10. This is the calculated check digit.
    7. Compare the calculated check digit with the 13th digit of the ISBN.
       If they match, the ISBN is valid.

    Example for "978-0-306-40615-7":
    - Digits: 9 7 8 0 3 0 6 4 0 6 1 5
    - Weights:1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3
    - Sum: (9*1)+(7*3)+(8*1)+(0*3)+(3*1)+(0*3)+(6*1)+(4*3)+(0*1)+(6*3)+(1*1)+(5*3)
      = 9 + 21 + 8 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 6 + 12 + 0 + 18 + 1 + 15 = 93
    - Modulo 10: 93 % 10 = 3
    - Check digit: 10 - 3 = 7
    - The 13th digit is 7, which matches. The ISBN is valid.

    Parameters
    ----------
    isbn: str
        The ISBN string, which may contain hyphens.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the ISBN is valid, False otherwise.

def spiral_matrix(n):
    '''Spiral Matrix Generator.

    Generate an n x n matrix filled with elements from 1 to n^2 in spiral order.

    For example, if n = 3, the matrix should be:
    [[1, 2, 3],
     [8, 9, 4],
     [7, 6, 5]]

    If n = 4, the matrix should be:
    [[ 1,  2,  3, 4],
     [12, 13, 14, 5],
     [11, 16, 15, 6],
     [10,  9,  8, 7]]

    This is a challenging problem that requires careful management of boundaries
    (top, bottom, left, right) and direction of movement.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n: int
        The dimension of the square matrix. A positive integer.

    Returns
    -------
    list[list[int]]
        A 2D list representing the n x n spiral matrix.
